                switching between Google Docs for writing, Discord for team chat,
                Notion for project planning, and your phone for the group WhatsApp.

                which version of the document is the latest. You're stressed,
                disorganized, and wondering why there isn't just ONE tool that handles
                everything you need for academic success."
