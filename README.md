## üéØ About Axonotes

Axonotes is envisioned as the ultimate command center for students and educators, designed to end the chaos of juggling
multiple applications. Our goal is to create a single, streamlined platform where notes, collaboration, planning,
learning tools (like flashcards and interactive exercises), and communication live together seamlessly.

We're building an all-in-one academic suite focused on:

* **Unified Workflow:** Notes, tasks, chat, and learning tools in one place.
* **Effortless Collaboration:** Real-time co-authoring with features like line-level locking.
* **Powerful Knowledge Creation:** Flexible note-taking (Markdown, rich text, infinite canvases, pen support), `LaTeX`
  support, and more.
* **Smart Organization:** Integrated planning, powerful global search, and knowledge graphs.
* **Offline-First & Cross-Platform:** Work anywhere, anytime, on any device (via AxonotesCore).
* **Revolutionary Version History:** Every change saved, powered by SpaceTimeDB (in AxonotesCore).
* **Secure & Private by Design:** Built with Swiss precision.

Learn more about the core application at the [AxonotesCore Repository](https://github.com/axonotes/AxonotesCore).
